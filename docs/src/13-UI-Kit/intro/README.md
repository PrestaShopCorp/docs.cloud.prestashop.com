# Migrating from the PrestaShop UIKit to PUIK

## Why This Documentation?

PrestaShop provides a **complete set of reusable UI components matching PrestaShop brand identity** and based on the PrestaShop Design System that can be used throughout the PrestaShop ecosystem.

- Its first version, the **PrestaShop UIKit**, relied on the [Bootstrap 4](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/) framework (see the related [documentation](https://devdocs.prestashop-project.org/8/development/uikit/) and [storybook](https://build.prestashop-project.org/prestashop-ui-kit/)).

- The latest version, named **PUIK**, is now based on [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation), a framework providing basic classes for frontend components (see the related [documentation](https://docs.uikit.prestashop.com/) and [storybook](https://uikit.prestashop.com/?path=/story/docs-introduction--page)).

The purpose of this documentation is to help you **migrate from the PrestaShop UIkit (initial version) to PUIK (latest version)**.

## Performing the Migration

For each component, you can either use **Vue.js** or the **CSS classes** from the theme. 

Start by preparing your environment by following the installation documentation for [Vue.js](https://uikit.prestashop.com/?path=/story/docs-vuejs-components--page) or the [CSS classes](https://uikit.prestashop.com/?path=/story/docs-css-components--page).

Then, access the pages corresponding to the components you are currently using to know more on how to upgrade each of them.
