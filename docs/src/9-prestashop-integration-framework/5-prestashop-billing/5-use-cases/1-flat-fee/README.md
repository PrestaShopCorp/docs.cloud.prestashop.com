# Flat Fee

In the flat fee pricing model, customers are charged a fixed and consistent amount for using the SaaS product or service. Regardless of the usage volume or frequency, the cost remains the same. This model offers simplicity and predictability, making it easy for customers to understand and budget their expenses. It is particularly suitable for users who require unlimited access to the SaaS product without worrying about usage-based charges.

**_Example:_** A mass data management SaaS offers a flat fee pricing model of 30€ per month for a basic plan and 60€ for a plan with more features.
