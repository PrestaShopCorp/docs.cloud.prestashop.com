# Charge at Term

The charge at term pricing model involves billing customers at fixed intervals, such as monthly or annually, regardless of their actual usage during that period. The pricing is usually based on a predefined set of features or service tiers offered by the SaaS provider. This model is suitable for SaaS that have many different prices such as parcel delivery services (which have variable prices depending on the weight, size and shipping address of the parcels)

**_Example:_**
A shipping company applies charge at term pricing for its business customer. They got a lot of different pricing regarding the size or the weight of each package. If a customer send 4 packages during the month with different pricing (2 at 12€, 1 at 5$ and 1 at 35€), the cost would be 64€ invoiced at the end of the billing period.
