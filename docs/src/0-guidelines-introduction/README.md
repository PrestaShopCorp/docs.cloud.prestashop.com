# Introduction to PrestaShop Marketplace Guidelines

## Who is this documentation for?

The PrestaShop Marketplace is the official platform where developers sell modules and themes to the whole PrestaShop worldwide ecosystem. This documentation is intended for partners, sellers, developers, and agencies who **create and distribute modules and/or themes** that will be added to the [**PrestaShop Marketplace**](https://addons.prestashop.com/en/).

## **Why read this?**

PrestaShop is an extremely customisable e-commerce platform that was designed so that third-party modules could easily build upon its foundations. Success on the marketplace requires understanding both the technical requirements and the quality standards that drive merchant trust and conversions.

## Marketplace Quality Philosophy

PrestaShop's marketplace strategy focuses on **product quality over quantity**. We prioritise:

- **Technical reliability** - Modules must work flawlessly across different environments
- **Security first** - Zero tolerance for security vulnerabilities
- **Merchant experience** - Every module must enhance, never hinder, the merchant's business
- **Long-term compatibility** - Products must evolve with PrestaShop versions

## **Tolerance Levels**

Across these guidelines, you will find the following tolerance levels from PrestaShop when it comes to accepting products in the Marketplace:

🚨 **Mandatory**: Guidelines that must be **strictly adhered to**. If not met the product will be rejected by PrestaShop teams.

⚠️ **Strongly Recommended**: Guidelines that should be **followed most of the time** due to their significant benefits and impact. They might become mandatory in the near future.

✅ **Best Practice**: Guidelines that are **recommended for optimal performance, and that are suitable to achieve PrestaShop’s recommended quality standards**, but not mandatory.

*PrestaShop reserves the right to take actions against sellers who do not comply with these Guidelines. (more details in [Compliance & Legal Obligations](/7-legal-and-compliance/#consequences-of-non-compliance-of-prestashop-marketplace-guidelines) section)*
