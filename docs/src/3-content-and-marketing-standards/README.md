# Content & Marketing Standards

A compelling product page is crucial for conversion. Every element must be crafted to build trust and communicate value clearly.

## Product Name Guidelines

#### 🚨 Naming Requirements
Your product name is the first impression merchants have:

**Structure Formula:** `[Primary Function]: [Brief Explanation]`

 👍 DO

- ✅ "Advanced SEO: Meta Tags & Rich Snippets Manager"
- ✅ "One-Page Checkout: Express Purchase Process"
- ✅ "Inventory Sync: Multi-Channel Stock Management"

👎 DON’T

- ❌ "PrestaShop" (redundant on the marketplace)
- ❌ "Module" or "Theme" (obvious from context)
- ❌ Version numbers ("v2.1", "2024 Edition")
- ❌ External brand names without permission
- ❌ Superlatives without proof ("Best", "Ultimate", "#1")

#### Length Limits:

- Maximum: 70 characters
- Optimal: 45-60 characters
- Must be unique across the marketplace

⚠️ *Please note that the product name you will choose will be used to generate your addons module’s link. Each time you’ll make a change in your product name it will create a new link and an automated redirection that might affect Google’s understanding and hence your SEO. **We strongly recommend to avoid changing your product name**.*

## Description and Benefits

#### 🚨 Short Description (250 characters max)
This appears on category pages and homepage features:

 👍 DO

- ✅ "Boost your SEO ranking with automated meta tags, structured data, and XML sitemaps. Generate rich snippets for products and increase click-through rates by up to 40%."

👎 DON’T

- ❌ "This module helps with SEO optimization for your store." *(too generic)*
- ❌ "Implements [schema.org](http://schema.org/) microdata with JSON-LD structured data output compatible with Google's Rich Results specifications." *(too technical)*

#### 🚨 Merchant Benefits (Required for modules)
Focus on business value, not features:

👍 DO

- ✅ "Reduce cart abandonment by 25% with streamlined checkout"
- ✅ "Save 10 hours/week on inventory management automation"
- ✅ "Increase average order value by 15% with smart cross-selling"

👎 DON’T

- ❌ "Uses AJAX for dynamic content loading" (technical feature, not benefit)

#### Customer Benefits
Explain the end-customer experience:

👍 DO

- ✅ "Customers enjoy faster page loading and mobile-optimised experience"
- ✅ "One-click reordering for returning customers increases satisfaction"
- ✅ "Real-time shipping costs prevent checkout surprises"

## Feature Documentation

#### 🚨 Minimum 3 Distinct Features
Each feature must be specific and measurable:

 👍 DO

- ✅ “Advanced filtering: 15+ filter types including price ranges, attributes, and custom fields”

## Tip: How to create a demo shop for your module

When you submit your product sheet, you can offer a demo shop for your module, so that merchants can test your module.

### 1. Add a new profile

To restrict use of the back office to configuring your module, you need to create a profile with limited rights.

In your back office, go to the Advanced Parameters, Team section, then to the Profiles tab:

![Add new profile](https://docs.cloud.prestashop.com/assets/images/demo/demo-1a.png)

Add a new profile:

![Add new profile](https://docs.cloud.prestashop.com/assets/images/demo/demo-1b.png)

### 2. Configure profile’s permissions

In the Permissions tab, select the profile you have just created and grant it the rights below. In the right-hand column, choose your module, which has already been installed in your shop.

![Configure permissions](https://docs.cloud.prestashop.com/assets/images/demo/demo-2a.png)

**WARNING**

Please note that the module configuration will only work with the default form (submit*TechnicalName*). If your module contains several configuration forms, this will not work.

### 3. Create a back office account

You can now create an account to access the back office with the permissions you created earlier.

In general, the email to use is **demo@demo.com** and the password **demodemo**.

![Create a user](https://docs.cloud.prestashop.com/assets/images/demo/demo-3a.png)

You need to set the default page to "Module Manager", the only one available with demo profile permissions.

![Create a user](https://docs.cloud.prestashop.com/assets/images/demo/demo-3b.png)

#### For PrestaShop 8.x

From PrestaShop 8, this password will be considered too simple, so you need to change the password policy in the security settings.

![Security policy](https://docs.cloud.prestashop.com/assets/images/demo/demo-3c.png)

### 4. Add the demo shop url to your product sheet

When you submit your product sheet, you can enter the information for your demo.

![Submission demo](https://docs.cloud.prestashop.com/assets/images/demo/demo-4a.png)

### 5. Other information about demo shops

#### Regular reset of demonstration instances

Even with restricted rights in the back office, visitors of the demo will be able to modify the module's configuration.

To ensure a consistent experience over time, we recommend that you reset the shop regularly (every night, for example) so that you return to a shop with the module's default settings. Or to just “reset” the module configuration itself.

#### Cookie management for display in the Addons iframe

The Addons marketplace displays demo shops via an iframe. The shop's cookie management must therefore be modified to allow this.

You need to change this setting to allow users to log in to the back office, in the Administration section.

![Submission demo](https://docs.cloud.prestashop.com/assets/images/demo/demo-5a.png)

This allows cookies from a domain name other than that of the shop to be authorised. **To be used for demonstration purposes only.**

You can also modify the **.htaccess** at the root of your shop to apply this rule to all cookies.

```jsx
<ifmodule mod_headers.c>
Header always edit Set-Cookie ^(.*)$ $1;SameSite=None;Secure
</ifmodule>
```
