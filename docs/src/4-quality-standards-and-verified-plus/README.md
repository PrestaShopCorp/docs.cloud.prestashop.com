# PrestaShop recommended Quality Standards

## Verified+ Badge

The **Verified+** badge represents the highest quality standard on the PrestaShop Marketplace. It signals to merchants that a module has passed comprehensive quality checks and meets PrestaShop's most stringent criteria for technical reliability for PrestaShop Store versions 1.7.8 and up.

**Warning: Verified+ badge does not cover PrestaShop versions under 1.7.8**

### What Verified+ Means

#### For Merchants:

- **Technical reliability** - Module works flawlessly across environments
- **Security assurance** - Zero known vulnerabilities or security risks
- **Future compatibility** - Guaranteed to work with latest PrestaShop versions (from 1.7.8)
- **Safe to use** - Strict override policy

#### For Developers:

- **Quality recognition** -  Official PrestaShop Marketplace endorsement of technical excellence
- **Competitive advantage** - Differentiation from standard modules
- **Enhanced search visibility** - Verified+ modules appear prominently in search results

### ðŸš¨ Verified + Requirements (All Must Pass)

1. **Clean Validator Scan** - Zero auto-decline issues from PrestaShop Validator
2. **Security Compliance** - No detected security vulnerabilities
3. **Minimal Overrides** - Only technically unavoidable overrides permitted
4. **PHP Compatibility** - Error-free execution on recommended PHP versions for each major PrestaShop Version the module claims to be compatible with (from 1.7.8 and up)
5. **Version Compatibility** - Works at least with the 2 latest major PrestaShop versions (8.x and 9.x)
6. **No Debug Mode errors** - No error on Debug Bug verifications for each PrestaShop Version the module claims to be compatible with (from 1.7.8 and up)

### When can you obtain the Verified + Badge ?

You do not need to request the badge. The PrestaShop Validation team assigns the badge during the standard validation process (described in the [Validation Workflow](/5-submission-and-validation-process/#validation-workflow) section).

For a given submission, if your module covers all the Verified + requirements then it will obtain the badge.

But, keep in mind that if you have received the badge once, and in a future submission your module does not meet all the requirements then the badge will be removed automatically.
